# Easy Faogen

This tool makes it fast and easy to quickly bake AO maps using [Faogen](http://www.faogen.com).aw

Instructions:
1. Install Faogen
2. Compile the script (or download the pre-compiled EXE) and then drag and drop a model on to the .exe.
3. Choose an output resolution, edge padding, quality, AA, then click bake.

If you have installed faogen somewhere other than the default location, then edit line 68 of the script to reflect the correct path to the faogenbatch.exe file.

Make sure your mesh is one combined model, or you will get a different AO image for each seperate mesh.
